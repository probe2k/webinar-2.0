    "#INTRODUCTION\n",
    "# Greetings everyone. This is Yash Singh from CSE IInd sem. This session is going to incorporate a crash course of the Python programming language. This however isn’t going to be an overhaul of the entire language – but just an overview of it and how well it translates to the user. If you're a beginner - I would sincerely recommend trying out logistics and algorithm understanding in a more low level language like C or C++ before you start with python - especially in the field of data science. So, before beginning, there's an important clearance that people with understanding of the basics should only attend it. However, if you are well versed with the code base of any language and the paradigm the execution data follows, you'll be well onboard with it. If you already have some understanding of python, and have coded in it, feel free to interrupt me in between and correct me where I might be going wrong. For the learners here, if you got any doubts, you can cut in between and shoot your queries."

    "# Now we shall go over the basics and configurations to begin with this session. Before I start, I want to ensure that all of you have anaconda-python 3 setup on your system along with any code editor of your choice - preferably VSCode. Make sure that you turn off telemetry if you're using VSCode. That's just a step towards user data privacy. Now, once you have both these tools configured/setup properly, what you're going to want to do is make sure anaconda is in your PATH variable. In linux, you can simply do this by exporting the PATH as export PATH=${PATH}:/<location>. And try not to use relative paths. Try to use absolute path. In windows, there might be a way to change path variable from settings > although I am not too familiar with it.\n",
    "# Eitherways, once you're done with that, start VSCode. And press Ctrl + Shift + P, and search for interpreter like me. Now don't pick the default python base which might be installed on your system. But go ahead, and from the list, choose the anaconda environment. Now, Again, press Ctrl + Shift + P for the VSCode prompt and search jupyter notebook. Click on this highlight, and it will start building up your notebook. It may take some time to initialize anaconda environment - to a max of about 5 mins on slower machines. But cmoparatively, it should be fast - especially on a linux file system because of much comprehensive tracker balancing. Once this is done, you'll get your cell - or the code cell, this is where you're supposed to write code, and then we'll guide you through the shortcuts which are comprehensively essential if you're going to be working with jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "# Now, another way to create and manage a notebook is by actually instantiating it beforehand, and then starting it with VSCode. Now, open your terminal inside VSCode (or powershell if you're a windows user) by pressing Ctrl + back ticks or the tilde sign which should be the first key on the second row of your computer. ALternatively, you can again goto console using Ctrl + Shift + P and type terminal, and it should open up the same. Then navigate to the desired directory where you want to create this project, and then type touch <filename>.ipynb which is the extension of any jupyter notebook. Note that we are using jupyter rather than a file based approach or directly the console just because it's more convenient for beginners to understand, and jupyter is quite interactive to the point where it returns to the user - the console output without a print statement. We'll see how that works in just a while. Now, once you've done that, you can either drag and drop that file from your file explorer to the VSCode editor, or you can simply do code <filename>.ipynb and it should open that up in your editor. Note that, this again might take a little while if anaconda daemon is not already active on your system, as it requires some time to start the jupyter server and activation python kernel. That is something we'll talk about later in perhaps another session where we deal with activation functions and kernel management. Now that we've our file ready in front of us, let's begin with the first line of code."

Once we're familiar with the good old functions and methods from all these libraries, we will start with machine learning in the next session. Coining at the top would be numpy, followed by matplotlib. One more thing to take into account here is - pandas somehow follows the same footprint as numpy, nd numpy is somehow a more robust library than pandas for memory management. However, pandas also have some amazing classes and functions that can be extremely useful in them.

It is a plotting library used to plot a specific range sepctrum from mathematical analysis to visual form. It inherits it's design and approach from MatLab's graphical plotting rule. It works well with numpy and pandas. Although matplotlib is a famous lib, there's essentially a lot more libraries out there like seaborn and stuff which are technically built over numpy. Installation on your system could be done with either anaconda or pip. Do note on linux or mac, it's very bad to run pip under root or with sudo. But that's out of scope for this session, so just wanna point that out - that you shouldn't be doing it. You can view it's documentation - as they contain numerous types of plot types to ensure any and every form of equation can have a visual representative header."
